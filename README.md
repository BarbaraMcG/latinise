- process_LatinISE_for_Nexus.py by Barbara McGillivray

This Python 3 script takes as input the .xml files from the LatinISE corpus, 
and returns a series of files that can be used to train diachronic word embeddings according 
to the following format:

file name: <language_code><date><file_identifier>, where
	- <language_code> (see Dublin Core Language and ISO 639.2)--> lat for Latin
	- <date> = <YYYY> | <YYYY-MM> | <YYYY-MM-DD>, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601: 1BCE=+000, 2BCE=-0001, 1CE=+0001, etc. 
	- <file_identifier> = specific to each dataset
general metadata, according to Dublin Core terms and depending on the availability of this type of information in the corpus (title, author, publisher, type, etc.) or alternatively, links to the original files with metadata (if available);

- Final_STSM_medical_latin.ipynb by Paola Marongiu (adapted from previous script by Barbara McGillivray)

This notebook analyses Latin medical lexicon in LatinISE with word embeddings.

- Embedding_analysis.ipynb by Barbara McGillivray and Paola Marongiu

This notebook is based on the previous one and generalises the analysis to a set of terms related to "revolution". Code inspired from https://github.com/BarbaraMcG/latinise/blob/master/lvlt22/Semantic_change.ipynb.
